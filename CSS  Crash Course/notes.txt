Box Model: a container that consists of multiple different properties 
    - content 
    - padding: make more space in contents 
    - border 
    - margin: best practice to use this to separate element 

Complex Properties: 
    - display: 
        - block: takes 100% width and starts on a new line e,g, <p> <div> 
        - inline: doesnt allow you to set a width or height for element and starts on same line e.g. <span> <img>
    - position:
        - static: follows normal flow of the pge 
        - relative: follows normal flow of page. Lets you position using top left bottom right
            - in style css you would change position to relative 
            - if you want to change the position of top, bottom, left, right. It would be the the position: 10px e.g. bottom: 10px
        - absolute: does not follow normal flow of page. Lets you position with top, left, bottom, right. position is based off closest "position:relative" parent 
            - doesnt take 100% of width need to set width 
            - child of a relative parent position, if we set position it will be set to the t,l,b,r of that parent
        - fixed: sticks element to a permanent location on the page. Lets you use t, l, b, r
        - sticky: sticks element to a permanent location on page once it hits a threshold

            }
    - hover: when u hover over an element it will change colour. you can also set a transition of the hover (effects)

                transition: background-colour 300ms; 
            }

What is BEM? BEM (block-element-modifies) is a naming convention used for CSS classes to make them easier to read and understand. 
    - B [block] is a block component 
    - E [element] is dependent on the block component 
    - M [modifier] is used to change style of the block
